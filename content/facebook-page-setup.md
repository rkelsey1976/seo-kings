Not sure how your business shows up on Google? Get a free local SEO audit from SEO Kings.

We'll check your Google Business Profile, your website, and where you rank in Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock and across BANES. Clear report, no jargon, no obligation.

Perfect for plumbers, electricians, roofers and local businesses who want more calls from Google. Get started: seo-kings.co.uk/contact

**Why local SEO**
```
When someone searches "plumber Bath" or "electrician Keynsham", Google shows 3 businesses in the map pack. If you're not in there, you're missing the clicks.

Local SEO gets you into that pack. We help Bath and BANES businesses rank higher so you get more visibility and more jobs. Free audit available — link in our bio.
```
