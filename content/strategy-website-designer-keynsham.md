## 3. Suggested strategy

### 3.1 Strengthen the Keynsham page for "website designer"

- **H2** – Add or tweak an H2 that includes **"website designer Keynsham"** (e.g. "Website designer & website design in Keynsham") so the exact phrase is on the page.
- **First paragraph** – Use "website designer in Keynsham" or "website design in Keynsham" once in the opening copy.
- **FAQ** – Add one FAQ, e.g. "Do you do website design in Keynsham?" or "Website designer Keynsham – what do you offer?" with a clear answer (what you do, price, who it’s for).

### 3.2 Differentiate in copy

- **Price** – You already say "from £399"; keep it visible (many competitors don’t).
- **Trades focus** – Emphasise "tradespeople and small businesses in Keynsham", "plumbers, electricians, builders in BS31" so you own a clear niche vs generalist agencies.
- **Proof** – Keynsham Electrics case study is on the area page; add a line like "We’ve helped Keynsham businesses like [Keynsham Electrics] get found on Google" and link to the case study or blog.

### 3.3 Blog and internal links

- **Blog** – You have `website-design-keynsham`. Ensure the post title or H1 includes **"website designer Keynsham"** (or "Website designer in Keynsham") and 1–2 natural mentions in the body.
- **Internal links** – From Keynsham area page, link to that post with anchor text "Website designer in Keynsham" or "Website design in Keynsham". Link from Web Design page to `/areas/keynsham` with "website design Keynsham".

### 3.4 Google Business Profile (GBP)

- **Services** – In GBP, include a service named "Website designer Keynsham" or "Website design Keynsham" (or both) with a short description (e.g. "Fast, mobile-friendly websites for Keynsham businesses from £399").
- **Description** – Your main GBP description already mentions Keynsham; keep "website designer" and "Keynsham" in the same sentence if it reads well.
- **Posts** – Occasionally use a post headline or text that includes "website designer Keynsham" or "website design Keynsham" (e.g. "Website design for Keynsham businesses – from £399").

### 3.5 Map pack and local signals

- **GBP** – Complete profile (category, services, description, hours, area covering Keynsham/BS31), photos, and reviews.
- **Consistency** – Same business name, area (Keynsham / Bath & North East Somerset), and service wording on site and GBP.
- **Reviews** – Encourage reviews that mention "website", "Google" or "Keynsham" where natural (without asking for specific wording).

### 3.6 Optional medium-term steps

- **One more Keynsham-focused piece** – e.g. "Website design for Keynsham trades – what we do and what it costs" or a short "Website designer Keynsham" landing section that links to `/web-design` and `/areas/keynsham`.
- **"Website designer near me" / BS31** – If you want to capture broader intent, add "website designer BS31" or "website design BS31" in one H2 or FAQ on the Keynsham page.
