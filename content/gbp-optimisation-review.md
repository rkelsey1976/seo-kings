# GBP Optimisation Review – Aligned With seo-kings.co.uk

Use this checklist to make sure your Google Business Profile (GBP) matches your site and is fully optimised for local search.

---

## 1. Business name & identity (must match site)

| Field | Use this (matches your site) |
|-------|------------------------------|
| **Business name** | **SEO Kings** (exactly as on site – no extra keywords) |
| **Website** | **https://seo-kings.co.uk** |

Your site uses “SEO Kings” and seo-kings.co.uk everywhere. Keep GBP identical.

---

## 2. Contact & location (must match site)

| Field | Use this |
|-------|----------|
| **Phone** | **07702 264 921** (or +44 7702 264 921 if GBP asks for international) |
| **Address** | Use the **real address** where you work (or service-area only if you don’t show an address on site). Your site says “Bath, Somerset” and “Serving all of BANES” – GBP address must be consistent. |
| **Service area** | If you use “Service area” in GBP, add: **Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Peasedown St John, Paulton, Saltford, Timsbury** (and any other BANES areas you serve). |

**Check:** Phone and website on your site are 07702 264 921 and https://seo-kings.co.uk. They must be identical in GBP.

---

## 3. Hours (match site)

Your Contact page says **Mon–Fri 9am–5pm**.

| In GBP | Set |
|--------|-----|
| **Opening hours** | Mon–Fri: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM. Sat–Sun: Closed (or “Not open” if you prefer). |
| **Special hours** | Add for bank holidays if you close (e.g. “Closed”). |

---

## 4. Category (critical for map pack)

| Priority | Category to choose |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Primary** | **Marketing agency** or **SEO service** (pick the one that best fits – “Marketing agency” is common for local SEO; “SEO service” if Google offers it). |
| **Secondary** | Add **Website designer** and **Advertising agency** if they fit and Google allows. |

Don’t stuff keywords into the business name; use categories to tell Google what you do.

---

## 5. Description (750 characters max)

Use one of the **GBP versions** from **content/gbp-business-description.md** (the 750-character blocks). They already match your site messaging and include:

- Local SEO agency in Bath, BANES
- Local SEO, GBP management, website design
- Tradespeople and local businesses
- Free local SEO audit
- “Based in Bath, serving BANES”

Paste one of those **exactly** into GBP → Edit profile → Business description. Don’t add extra keywords; keep it readable.

---

## 6. Services (match site pages)

Your site has: **Website Design**, **Local SEO**, **Google Business Profile**, **Free SEO Audit** (contact).

In GBP → **Services**, add these with the descriptions from **content/gbp-services-descriptions.md**:

| Service name (in GBP) | Use description from |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Local SEO | gbp-services-descriptions.md – “Rank on Google when Bath & BANES customers search…” |
| Google Business Profile Management | gbp-services-descriptions.md – “We optimise and manage your GBP…” |
| Website Design | gbp-services-descriptions.md – “Website Design - Fast, mobile-friendly websites…” |
| Free Local SEO Audit | gbp-services-descriptions.md – “Free audit: we check your GBP, website…” (optional but good for leads) |

Keep **service names** and **descriptions** identical to the doc so site and GBP stay aligned.

---

## 7. Attributes

In GBP → **Edit profile** → **Attributes**, fill everything that applies, for example:

- **From the business:** e.g. “Identifies as women-owned” / “Identifies as LGBTQ+ owned” only if true.
- **Service options:** “Online estimates”, “Remote services” (if you do audits/calls remotely).
- **Planning:** “Appointment required” if you want calls/appointments only.
- **Payments:** “Bank transfer”, “Credit card” (match what you actually accept).

Don’t add attributes that don’t apply; accuracy matters more than filling every box.

---

## 8. Photos

| Type | What to add |
|------|-------------|
| **Logo** | Square logo (at least 250×250 px). Same as on site if possible. |
| **Cover** | Main image (e.g. team, Bath office, or “local SEO” style image). |
| **Gallery** | 5–10 photos: team, workspace, Bath/local, laptop/meetings, before/after or results (if you have). |

Use the same branding and tone as seo-kings.co.uk. Add 1–2 new photos per month.

---

## 9. Posts (weekly)

Use **content/gbp-posts-seo-optimised.md**. Each post has:

- **Post type** (Offer or Update)
- **Headline** (~58 chars)
- **Body** (paste as-is)
- **CTA** and **link** (all links must go to **https://seo-kings.co.uk/...**)

Current links in the doc:

- Contact: **https://seo-kings.co.uk/contact**
- Local SEO: **https://seo-kings.co.uk/local-seo**
- GBP: **https://seo-kings.co.uk/google-business-profile**
- Web design: **https://seo-kings.co.uk/web-design**
- Case study (Peachy Cleans): **https://seo-kings.co.uk/case-studies/peachy-cleans**

Post at least **once a week**. Rotate free audit (Offer) with updates (Local SEO, GBP, web design, case studies).

---

## 10. Q&A (pre-populate and answer fast)

Add your own **Questions & answers** in GBP so you control the message. Examples aligned with your site:

| Question | Suggested answer (short) |
|----------|---------------------------|

---

## 11. Products / Services (if you use the “Services” tab)

If your GBP has a “Services” or “Products” section, keep it in line with **content/gbp-services-descriptions.md** and your site:

- Local SEO  
- Google Business Profile Management  
- Website Design  
- Free Local SEO Audit (optional)

Same names and short descriptions as in section 6.

---

## 12. Consistency check (site vs GBP)

| Item | Site (seo-kings.co.uk) | GBP must match |
|------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Business name | SEO Kings | SEO Kings |
| Phone | 07702 264 921 | 07702 264 921 |
| Website | https://seo-kings.co.uk | https://seo-kings.co.uk |
| Location | Bath, Somerset | Same city/region; address as you use on site |
| Hours | Mon–Fri 9am–5pm | Mon–Fri 9:00–17:00 |
| Areas | Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Peasedown St John, Paulton, Saltford, Timsbury | Same in service area / description |
| Services | Website Design, Local SEO, GBP, Free Audit | Same in GBP Services |

Any mismatch (e.g. different phone or URL) can hurt trust and local ranking.
