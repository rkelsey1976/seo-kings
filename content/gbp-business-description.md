# SEO Kings – Business Description for Google Business Profile

## Full version (750 words – use for website, proposals, About page)

SEO Kings is a local SEO agency based in Bath, serving businesses across Bath and North East Somerset (BANES). We help tradespeople and small businesses get found on Google so they can win more customers in their area. We don’t do national campaigns or big-brand work — we focus only on local. That focus is what makes us different.

**What we do**

We offer three core services. First, **local SEO**: we optimise your website and online presence so you show up when people in Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, and the rest of BANES search for what you do. That means better rankings in Google’s local pack and organic results, and more visibility where it actually matters — on the devices of people ready to call or visit. Second, **Google Business Profile (GBP) management**: we set up, verify, and optimise your Google listing so you appear in the map pack, collect more reviews, and look professional and trustworthy. Many of our clients see a big jump in calls and direction requests once their GBP is done properly. Third, **website design**: we build clear, fast, mobile-friendly sites that are built for local search and for turning visitors into enquiries. Every site we build is optimised for Google and for your local customers.

**Who we work with**

We work mainly with tradespeople — plumbers, electricians, roofers, builders, landscapers — and with other local service businesses: salons, dentists, accountants, restaurants, and independents across BANES. If your business depends on customers finding you locally, we can help. We’ve worked with over 150 local businesses and we understand how local search works in this area: the competition, the keywords, and what it takes to rank.

**How we work**

We keep things simple. No jargon, no vanity metrics. You get a clear plan, regular updates, and reports that focus on what matters: how often you’re showing up in search, how many people are calling or filling in forms, and how your Google Business Profile is performing. We explain everything in plain English. We’re also transparent on pricing: we quote fairly, and there are no hidden fees. Our goal is a long-term partnership — when you grow, we grow.

**Why local matters**

When someone in Bath searches for “plumber Bath” or “electrician Keynsham”, Google shows a local pack of three businesses and a map. If you’re not in that pack, you’re almost invisible. We get you into that pack and keep you there. We also make sure your name, address, and phone number are consistent everywhere online, that you have a strong Google Business Profile with photos and reviews, and that your website is fast, clear, and built for local search. Those are the foundations that bring in more calls and more jobs.

**Results**

Our clients typically see a significant increase in leads within six months. We don’t promise overnight miracles — local SEO takes a few months to build — but we do deliver. We’ve helped tradespeople and local businesses go from barely visible on Google to ranking on page one for their most important searches. We’re proud of our track record and our reviews, and we’re happy to talk through what’s realistic for your business.

**Get in touch**

If you’re a tradesperson or a local business in Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, or anywhere in BANES, and you want to get found by more local customers, we’d like to hear from you. We offer a free local SEO audit so you can see where you stand and what we’d recommend. Get in touch by phone, email, or through our website — we’re here to help.
