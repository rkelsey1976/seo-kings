## How to make Keynsham GBP number 1

**Goal:** Rank #1 (or top of map pack) for searches like "website design Keynsham", "plumber Keynsham", "electrician Keynsham", "electrician BS31" and get maximum visibility for Keynsham.

1. **Post at least once a week** — Fresh posts signal an active, relevant business. Rotate the 6–7 posts so Keynsham and BS31 appear often.

2. **Put Keynsham + main keyword in the headline** — First ~58 characters matter most. E.g. "Website Design Keynsham — From £399" or "Get to #1 on Google in Keynsham & BS31".

3. **Use "number one" / "#1" / "top of Google" / "map pack" where it fits** — Real result (Keynsham Electrics) proves it works; mention "top 3" or "#1" in case study and "get to #1" in get-found posts.

4. **Use a strong Keynsham image** — Local photo (Keynsham/BS31) or graphic with "Keynsham" or "BS31" in the image. Helps relevance and engagement.

5. **Link every post to the best Keynsham page** — Area page (/areas/keynsham), case study (/case-studies/keynsham-electrics), /local-seo or /contact. Same URL in CTA button and (if allowed) in body.

6. **Use the Free Check as an Offer post** — Offer-type posts can get extra visibility. Post 5 is already an Offer; use it every 2–3 cycles.

7. **Match your GBP profile** — Business description and services should include "Keynsham", "BS31", "website design Keynsham", "plumber Keynsham", "Bitton", "Saltford". Same phrases you use in posts.

8. **Reviews and Q&A** — Encourage reviews that mention "Keynsham" or "BS31". Answer Q&A with Keynsham-focused, helpful replies.
