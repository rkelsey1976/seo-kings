## Short version (for Google review)

We had no website and no Google listing — customers couldn’t find us. SEO Kings built our site and set up our Google profile. Within a week we were showing up on Google Maps and getting found for painter and decorator searches in Bath and the area. Professional, fast, and it actually works. Highly recommend.

## Full version (for case study / website)

We had no website and no Google listing, so when people searched for a painter and decorator in Bath we simply didn’t show up. SEO Kings built us a proper website and sorted our Google Business Profile so everything works together. Within a week we were in the top results on Google Maps and ranking for the right searches. No jargon, no messing about — they just got it done. Really pleased with the result and would recommend them to any trade in Bath or BANES.
