## Tips

- **Post with image:** Use 1 (hero) or 2 (areas) with the matching image for best engagement.
- **CTA first or last:** Either open with the benefit and end with CTA, or put CTA in the first line (“Get your free audit…”) then explain.
- **Link:** Always include seo-kings.co.uk (and optionally the contact page: seo-kings.co.uk/contact).
- **Frequency:** 1–3 posts per week is enough; reuse these and swap the CTA line.
