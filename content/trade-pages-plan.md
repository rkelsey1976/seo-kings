# Trade Pages Plan – Target Different Trades (Plumbers, Electricians, etc.)

**Recommendation: Yes.** Creating pages that target specific trades (e.g. “SEO for Plumbers in Bath & BANES”) is a strong local SEO tactic. It helps you rank for searches like “SEO for plumbers Bath”, “local SEO electricians Keynsham”, and “website for roofers BANES”, and it speaks directly to each audience.

## Why trade pages help

| Benefit | How |
|--------|-----|
| **More keywords** | You rank for “[trade] + [location]” and “SEO for [trade]” without stuffing the main Local SEO page. |
| **Clear intent** | Someone searching “SEO for plumbers Bath” sees a page built for them, which improves relevance and conversion. |
| **Internal linking** | Area pages and the main Local SEO page can link to trade pages (e.g. “We help plumbers in Bath rank on Google”). |
| **Case study fit** | You can reference relevant case studies (e.g. Mitchell Plumbing on the plumbers page). |

## Which trades to target first

Prioritise trades you already mention and have case studies for:

| Trade | Rationale | Case study / proof |
|-------|-----------|--------------------|
| **Plumbers** | High search volume; you mention “plumber Bath” everywhere. | Mitchell Plumbing |
| **Electricians** | Strong local demand; you mention electricians in areas. | Keynsham Electrics |
| **Roofers** | Good local volume. | Norton Roofing |
| **Builders** | Broad term; often searched with location. | — |
| **Landscapers / gardeners** | You have local keywords for these in areas. | — |
| **Cleaning services** | You have Peachy Cleans. | Peachy Cleans |

Start with **Plumbers**, **Electricians**, **Roofers** (you have case studies). Add **Builders**, **Landscapers**, **Cleaning** when you’re ready.

## URL structure (two options)

| Option | Example | Pros / cons |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **A. Under Local SEO** | `/local-seo/plumbers`, `/local-seo/electricians` | Clear that it’s “local SEO for this trade”; keeps services under one section. |
| **B. Dedicated “For” section** | `/for-plumbers`, `/for-electricians` | Short URLs; can cover SEO + web design + GBP in one page per trade. |

**Recommendation:** **Option A** (`/local-seo/plumbers`, etc.) so each page is clearly “Local SEO for [trade]”. You can add a second set later (e.g. `/web-design/plumbers`) if you want to target “website for plumbers” separately.

---

## What each trade page should include

Keep each page **clearly different** (don’t just swap the trade name). Aim for 400–800 words of unique content per page.

1. **Headline**  
   e.g. “Local SEO for Plumbers in Bath & BANES” or “Get More Plumbing Jobs from Google”.

2. **Intro (1–2 short paragraphs)**  
   Why plumbers (or that trade) in Bath/BANES need to be found on Google; what you do for them.

3. **What you do for [trade]**  
   Bullet or short sections: keyword research for “[trade] Bath” etc., GBP optimisation, website SEO, local citations, review growth. Reuse your existing service logic but framed for that trade.

4. **Areas you serve**  
   Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Peasedown St John, Paulton, Saltford, Timsbury. Optional: link to 2–3 area pages.

5. **Case study or result (if you have one)**  
   e.g. “We helped Mitchell Plumbing rank #1 for ‘plumber Bath’…” with a link to the case study.

6. **Short FAQ (2–4 questions)**  
   e.g. “How much does SEO cost for a plumber?”, “How long until I see results?”, “Do you work with one-man bands?”.

7. **CTA**  
   Free audit; link to contact and phone number.

8. **SEO**  
   - **Title:** e.g. `Local SEO for Plumbers in Bath & BANES | SEO Kings`  
   - **Meta description:** ~150 chars, include “plumbers”, “Bath”, “BANES”, “free audit”.  
   - **Canonical:** e.g. `https://seo-kings.co.uk/local-seo/plumbers`  
   - **Breadcrumbs:** Home → Local SEO → For Plumbers (or “Plumbers”).

## How it fits your current site

| Where | Change |
|-------|--------|
| **Local SEO page** | Add a “Who we help” or “We work with” section with links to `/local-seo/plumbers`, `/local-seo/electricians`, `/local-seo/roofers`. |
| **Area pages** | In “Our SEO services in [Area]” or similar, add one line: “We help plumbers, electricians and roofers in [Area] get found on Google” with links to the trade pages. |
| **Nav / footer** | Optional: “For plumbers”, “For electricians” etc. under Services or as a sub-menu. Not essential; internal links from Local SEO and Areas are enough to start. |
| **Sitemap** | Add each new trade page URL. |

---

## Content to avoid

- **Thin or duplicate content:** Don’t create 10 trade pages that only change the trade name and a few words. Each page should have unique intro, FAQs, and (where possible) a different angle or case study.
- **Keyword stuffing:** Use the trade and location naturally in headings and body; no need to repeat “plumber Bath” in every sentence.

---

## Suggested order of work

1. **Create 3 trade pages first:** Plumbers, Electricians, Roofers (you have case studies).  
2. **Add internal links** from the main Local SEO page and from 2–3 area pages (e.g. Bath, Keynsham).  
3. **Add URLs to sitemap** and submit in GSC.  
4. **Monitor** rankings for “SEO for plumbers Bath”, “local SEO electricians Keynsham”, etc.  
5. **Add more trades** (Builders, Landscapers, Cleaning) when you have time or a case study to reference.

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Should you create pages targeting different trades? | **Yes.** |
| Best URL structure? | `/local-seo/plumbers`, `/local-seo/electricians`, `/local-seo/roofers`, etc. |
| Which trades first? | Plumbers, Electricians, Roofers (then Builders, Landscapers, Cleaning). |
| What on each page? | Unique intro, what you do for that trade, areas, case study link, short FAQ, CTA, proper title/description/canonical. |
| How to connect? | Link from Local SEO page and from Area pages; add new URLs to sitemap. |

If you want, the next step is to add the first trade page (e.g. Plumbers) to the codebase with the structure above, then replicate for Electricians and Roofers.
