## 2. Next steps (in order of impact)

### A. On-page: weave related keywords into existing pages

1. **/web-design**
   - Add one H2 or short section that uses 2–3 related terms, e.g. “One-page website and full sites” or “Affordable website design for small business” with a sentence that includes “fast, mobile-friendly website”, “website that ranks”, “website for trades”.
   - In the FAQ, add one question that uses “affordable website”, “one-page website”, or “website for local business”.
   - Optionally add “website builder” once in the body (e.g. “We build websites for local businesses — no DIY website builder, just a site that’s built to rank.”).

2. **/web-design-packages**
   - In meta keywords (and one line in body), add: one-page website, affordable website, website for trades, small business website.
   - In the pricing/hero copy, keep “from £399” and add “affordable website design” or “one-page website for local business” once.

3. **Homepage**
   - In the Services section or one CTA, use “website design” or “web design” with location once (e.g. “Website design in Bath & BANES”) so the homepage reinforces the main service phrase.

### B. Blog: one or two posts for related terms

4. **Blog post for related keywords**
   - One post targeting **“one-page website”** or **“affordable website design”** (e.g. “One-Page Website for Small Business: When It Works and What We Build”) — use “one-page website”, “affordable website design”, “website for trades”, “website that ranks” in title, meta, and H2s. Link to /web-design and /web-design-packages.
   - Or: “Website for Trades: What We Build for Plumbers, Electricians and Builders in Bath & BANES” — targets “website for trades” and “website for plumbers/electricians” with location.

5. **Existing location posts**
   - In the Bath, Keynsham, Radstock, Trowbridge posts, add one sentence each that uses “one-page website”, “affordable website”, or “website that ranks” so those pages also match related searches.

### C. Internal linking and navigation

6. **Internal links**
   - From /local-seo and /google-business-profile, add one link to /web-design with anchor text like “Website design” or “Get a website that ranks”.
   - From homepage “Services”, ensure the web design service clearly says “Website design” or “Web design” and links to /web-design.

### D. Google Business Profile (GBP)

7. **GBP**
   - In GBP services and business description, include “website design”, “web design”, “business website”, “one-page website” and “Bath”, “BANES” so your profile matches website-design and location searches.

### E. Measure and iterate

8. **Search Console**
   - Track queries containing “website design”, “web design”, “one-page website”, “affordable website”, “website for trades”, “website builder” (and + Bath, BANES, etc.). See which phrases bring impressions/clicks and double down in content and meta.
