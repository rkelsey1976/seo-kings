## 2. What you already have

| Asset | What it does for website design + location |
|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| **/web-design** | Title/description/keywords include Bath, BANES, Keynsham, Trowbridge, Midsomer Norton. “Areas we serve” section with links: Website design Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock. Schema with areaServed. |
| **/web-design-packages** | Packages page; keywords include Bath, Trowbridge, Keynsham. |
| **/areas/[slug]** | Area pages (Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, etc.) — currently focus on **local SEO** and trades; they do **not** yet target “website design [area]” in title, H1, or body. |
| **Blog: Peachy Cleans post** | One post targeting “website design Midsomer Norton” — good proof and keyword coverage for one location. |
| **Internal links** | Web design page links to area pages with “Website design [Area]” anchor text. Area pages link to services but not specifically to “website design [area]”. |

**Gap:** Most location-specific demand is only on the main web design page. Area pages don’t yet reinforce “website design [location]”, and only Midsomer Norton has a dedicated blog post.

## 3. Plan: how to get better SEO results for website design (*location*)

### A. On-page (existing pages)

1. **/web-design**
   - Keep title/description/keywords as they are (already location-rich).
   - In the “Areas we serve” section, add **more locations** as links if you serve them: e.g. Peasedown St John, Paulton, Saltford, Timsbury with anchor text “Website design [Area]”.
   - Optionally add a short paragraph per main area (Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Trowbridge) that includes “website design [Area]” and “web design [Area]” once each, and links to the relevant area page.

2. **/web-design-packages**
   - In meta description (and optionally one line in the body), mention 2–3 locations, e.g. “Website design packages for Bath, Keynsham, Midsomer Norton and BANES.”

3. **Area pages (/areas/bath, /areas/keynsham, /areas/midsomer-norton, etc.)**
   - Add “website design [Area]” and “web design [Area]” to:
     - **Meta:** e.g. in description: “… We also offer website design in [Area] …”
     - **H2 or body:** e.g. “Website design in [Area]” with 1–2 sentences (fast, mobile-friendly sites for local businesses) and a link to /web-design or /web-design-packages.
   - Add a clear **internal link** from each area page to the web design page with anchor text “Website design [Area]” or “Web design [Area]”.

This way every area page becomes a small landing point for “website design [location]” and passes relevance to your main web design page.

### B. Content (blog + spotlight)

4. **Blog: one post per key location**
   - You already have: **Website design Midsomer Norton** (Peachy Cleans).
   - Add similar posts for:
     - **Website design Bath** (e.g. “Website design in Bath: what we build for trades and local businesses”)
     - **Website design Keynsham**
     - **Website design Radstock** (or Somer Valley)
     - **Website design Trowbridge** (if you want to capture Wiltshire)
   - Each post: title and meta with “website design [Location]” / “web design [Location]”, one real project or a general “what we build” angle, same CTA pattern (spotlight, packages, contact). Reuse the Peachy Cleans post structure.

5. **Spotlight/case study**
   - Keep spotlight and case study as they are; they already support “website design Midsomer Norton”. When you have a Bath or Keynsham website project, add a short spotlight or blog post for that location.

### C. Internal linking

6. **Web design → areas**
   - Already good: “Website design Bath”, “Website design Keynsham”, etc. Add any missing areas (Peasedown, Paulton, Saltford, Timsbury) with the same pattern.

7. **Areas → web design**
   - From every area page: one prominent link “Website design [Area]” or “Web design in [Area]” to /web-design (or /web-design-packages where it fits). Use the same phrase in the H2/sentence you add in 3.

8. **Blog → web design & areas**
   - Each “website design [location]” post: link to /web-design, /web-design-packages, and the relevant area page (e.g. /areas/bath). Use “website design Bath” (or that area) in the link text at least once.

### D. Technical & discovery

9. **Sitemap**
   - Ensure /web-design, /web-design-packages, /spotlight/peachy-cleans, and all /areas/[slug] and /blog/[slug] are in sitemap.xml. Add new blog posts when you publish them.

10. **Schema**
    - Web design page already has Service + areaServed. Keep it; optionally add same pattern to web-design-packages if you add a JSON-LD block there.

## 4. Prioritised action list

| Priority | Action | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Add “website design [Area]” to **area pages**: meta description, one H2 + paragraph, and a link to /web-design with anchor “Website design [Area]”. | Every area page starts ranking for “website design [location]” and feeds strength to /web-design. |
| 2 | Add **blog posts** for “website design Bath” and “website design Keynsham” (same structure as Midsomer Norton post). | More long-tail and location-specific pages. |
| 3 | On **/web-design**, add area links for Peasedown, Paulton, Saltford, Timsbury if you serve them. | Broader coverage and internal links. |
| 4 | On **/web-design-packages**, add 1–2 location phrases in meta and body. | Stronger relevance for “website design packages Bath” etc. |
| 5 | Add **website design Radstock** and **website design Trowbridge** blog posts (or combined “Somer Valley” / “Wiltshire”) if you want those areas. | Capture more location variants. |
| 6 | Check **sitemap** includes all web design, area, and blog URLs; submit in Search Console. | Discovery and indexing. |

---

## 5. How to measure

- **Search Console:** Track impressions/clicks for queries containing “website design” + “Bath”, “Keynsham”, “Midsomer Norton”, “BANES”, “Trowbridge”, etc.
- **Rankings:** Note positions for “website design Bath”, “web design Midsomer Norton”, “website design Keynsham” (and others) before and after changes.
- **Traffic:** Compare traffic to /web-design and /web-design-packages from organic search, especially from location-based keywords.

---

## 6. Summary

- **Best leverage:** Make every **area page** target “website design [location]” (meta + one section + link to /web-design). Then add **one blog post per main location** (Bath, Keynsham, then Radstock/Trowbridge if needed).
- **Keep:** Current web design title/description, “Areas we serve” links, schema, and the Midsomer Norton blog post.
- **Result:** More pages that match “website design [location]” and a clear internal linking path from area and blog to your main web design and packages pages, so you can improve SEO results for website design (*location*) in a structured way.
