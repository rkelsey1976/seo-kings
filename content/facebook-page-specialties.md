# SEO Kings – Facebook Page Specialties

Use these when editing your **Facebook Page → About → Specialties** (or **Page info → Specialties**). Facebook may show a single "Specialty" field or let you add multiple. Pick the ones that fit your page best; if there’s a character limit, use the short list first.

## Where to add on Facebook

1. Go to your **SEO Kings** Facebook Page.
2. Click **About** (or the **…** menu → **Page info**).
3. Find **Specialty** or **Specialties**.
4. Click **Edit** and add the phrases above (comma-separated or one per line, depending on how Facebook shows the field).
5. Save.

If your page type is “Business & Economy” or “Marketing Agency”, the Specialty field may appear under “More” or in the “About” section. Add as many as the field allows; the short list and recommended combo are good defaults.
