# Plan to Increase Your Google Business Profile (GBP) Rating

A practical plan to get more reviews, improve your star rating, and strengthen your GBP for SEO Kings (or any local business).

---

## 1. Get more reviews (the main lever)

**Why it matters:** More genuine reviews = higher rating potential, more trust, and better visibility in the map pack.

### Actions

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Ask at the right moment** | After a successful project, a positive call, or when a client says something nice — ask: “If you’re happy with how things went, a Google review would mean a lot.” |
| **Make it easy** | Send a direct link to your GBP review form. In GBP: **Get more reviews** → copy the short link (e.g. `https://g.page/r/.../review`). Use this in emails, texts, and on your site. |
| **Add a review CTA on your site** | On your contact or thank-you page, add: “Enjoyed working with us? Leave us a review on Google” + the review link. |
| **Follow up once** | 1–2 weeks after a job or audit, send one friendly email or message: “Hope everything’s going well. If you have a minute, we’d really appreciate a Google review.” Include the link. |
| **Don’t incentivise** | Never offer money, discounts, or gifts in exchange for reviews. Google’s policy forbids it and can lead to removals or penalties. |

**Target:** Aim for 1–2 new reviews per month as a minimum; more if you have a steady flow of clients.

## 2. Respond to every review

**Why it matters:** Google favours businesses that respond. It shows you care and can soften the impact of the occasional negative review.

### Actions

| Review type | What to do |
|-------------|------------|
| **5-star / positive** | Thank them by name, mention something specific (e.g. “Thanks for the kind words about the audit”). Keep it short (2–3 sentences). |
| **3–4 star** | Thank them, acknowledge their feedback, and say you’re always improving. Invite them to get in touch if they have suggestions. |
| **1–2 star / negative** | Stay calm and professional. Apologise for their experience (without admitting liability if it’s disputed). Offer to take it offline: “We’d like to make this right. Please call us on [number] or email [address].” Do not argue or get defensive. |

**Rule:** Reply within 24–48 hours when possible. Set a weekly reminder to check GBP for new reviews.

## 3. Optimise your GBP so it’s worth reviewing

**Why it matters:** A complete, active profile looks credible and encourages people to leave a review.

### Checklist

| Item | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Business info** | Name, address, phone, website, hours 100% correct and consistent with your website. |
| **Category** | Primary category = your main service (e.g. “Marketing agency” or “SEO service”). Add secondary categories if they fit. |
| **Description** | Use your best 750 characters (see `gbp-business-description.md`). Include location (Bath, BANES) and what you do. |
| **Services** | List all services with short descriptions (see `gbp-services-descriptions.md`). |
| **Attributes** | Fill every relevant attribute (e.g. “Identifies as women-owned”, “Online estimates”, etc.). |
| **Photos** | Add 5–10 quality photos: team, office, work in action, Bath/local. Add 1–2 new photos per month. |
| **Posts** | Post at least once a week (offers, updates, case studies). Use `gbp-posts-seo-optimised.md` for ideas. |
| **Q&A** | Add your own FAQs and answers (e.g. “What areas do you cover?”, “How much does an SEO audit cost?”). Answer any new questions within 24–48 hours. |
| **Products/Services** | If you use the “Services” section, keep it up to date with clear names and short descriptions. |

## 4. Use a direct review link everywhere

**Why it matters:** Friction kills reviews. One click from “I’m happy” to “Leave a review” works best.

### Where to put the link

1. **Email signature** – Short line: “Leave us a review on Google” (linked).
2. **Thank-you page** – After contact form submit (e.g. `/thank-you`): “Loved working with us? [Leave a Google review](link).”
3. **End of project** – In your final email or handover: “If you’re happy with the results, a Google review would mean a lot. [Leave a review](link).”
4. **Website footer or Contact page** – “Rate us on Google” with the link.

**How to get your link:**  
GBP → **Home** or **Profile** → **Get more reviews** → copy the short URL Google gives you.

## 5. Track and maintain

| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Check for new reviews | At least weekly (set a calendar reminder). |
| Respond to new reviews | Within 24–48 hours. |
| Publish a GBP post | At least once a week. |
| Add or refresh photos | 1–2 per month. |
| Check Q&A | Weekly; answer any new questions. |
| Verify NAP + hours + website | Once a quarter. |

---

## 6. What to avoid

- **Don’t buy reviews** or use review farms — policy breach and risk of removal.
- **Don’t offer incentives** for reviews (money, freebies, discounts for a review).
- **Don’t ask only happy customers** to review in a way that implies you’ll only ask if they’re happy (Google can see patterns). Asking everyone is fine; making it easy for everyone is best.
- **Don’t reply to negatives with blame or argument** — stay professional and take the conversation offline.
- **Don’t ignore low ratings** — one thoughtful response can show others you care and can win back the customer.

## Quick wins (do this week)

2. **Respond** to any review you haven’t replied to yet.
3. **Publish one post** (e.g. free audit offer from `gbp-posts-seo-optimised.md`).
4. **Add 2–3 photos** if your profile has fewer than 5.
5. **Add 3 Q&As** (e.g. areas covered, what’s included in an audit, how to get started).
