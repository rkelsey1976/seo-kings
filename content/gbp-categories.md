# SEO Kings – Google Business Profile categories

Use these in **Google Business Profile → Edit profile → Business category**. You get **one primary** and up to **9 additional** categories. Google matches your profile to searches based on these, so pick the ones that best describe what you do.

## Recommended

### Primary category (choose one)

Pick the one that fits best; Google weights the primary category most.

| Category to search for in GBP | Why |
|------------------------------|-----|
| **Marketing agency** | Broad, well-understood; matches “SEO agency” and “marketing” searches. |
| **Internet marketing service** | Closer to SEO/digital; good if “Marketing agency” feels too broad. |
| **SEO service** or **Search engine optimization service** | Use if Google offers it; very direct for “SEO Bath” type searches. |

**Best bet for SEO Kings:** Start with **Marketing agency** as primary (most likely to exist and to match “SEO agency Bath” and “local SEO Bath”). If you see **SEO service** or **Internet marketing service**, either could work as primary instead — choose the one that appears when you type “SEO” or “marketing” in the category field.

### Additional categories (add up to 9)

Add these only if they appear in the dropdown when you type them. Google’s list is fixed and varies by region.

- **Web design company** — for “website design Bath” type searches  
- **Advertising agency** — if you run any ads or want to show for “marketing”  
- **Marketing consultant** — consulting / audits  
- **Local business service** — if available; reinforces “local”  
- **Business development service** — if available  

Don’t add categories that don’t match your core work (e.g. avoid “Plumber” or “Electrician” — you serve them, you’re not one).

## How to set it

1. In **Google Business Profile**, go to **Edit profile**.  
2. Find **Business category** and click it.  
3. **Type** the category name (e.g. “Marketing agency” or “SEO service”); pick from the suggestions.  
4. Set **one primary**; add **additional** categories if they fit.  
5. Save.

## Summary

| Slot | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| **Primary** | **Marketing agency** (or **SEO service** / **Internet marketing service** if you prefer and they appear). |
| **Additional** | **Web design company**; then **Advertising agency**, **Marketing consultant**, or **Local business service** only if they appear and fit. |

This keeps your GBP aligned with searches like “local SEO Bath”, “SEO agency Bath”, and “website design Bath” without stretching into unrelated categories.
